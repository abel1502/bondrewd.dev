- header: Flexibile
  description: >-
    Bondrewd's unique approach to compile-time execution allows for incredible
    flexibility at compile time. The language constructs and the build process
    can be influenced from within the same code. The
    {{ site.shukufuku_translation }} model of treating the program as its own
    compilation script brings Python's levels of expressiveness and dynamicity
    to compile-time Bondrewd.
- header: Performant
  description: >-
    Bondrewd is statically typed with no runtime overhead by default. You can
    expect your Bondrewd programs to be as fast as if they were written in C++
    or Rust. At the same time you have fine control over the resulting
    executable, allowing you to consciously trade performance for other
    desirable properties.
- header: Uniform
  description: >-
    Bondrewd is made to be internally consistent and predictable. There are
    minimal special cases and exceptions, even for core language features. This
    means that the language itself operates by the same principles as the
    programs written in it, making it easy to reason about reflection and
    metaprogramming.
- header: General-Purpose
  description: >-
    Bondrewd is a general-purpose programming language. Its doesn't impose
    arbitrary limitations, and its flexiblility allows it to be adapted to
    any specific domain.
- header: Familiar
  description: >-
    Bondrewd doesn't try to reinvent the wheel. It takes inspiration from
    existing languages, adopting the good ideas and avoiding the bad ones.
    This, along with its simple and uniform design, makes it easy to learn for
    anyone with prior programming experience.
- header: Cross-Platform
  description: >-
    Thanks to Bondrewd's compile-time flexibility, targeting different
    platforms is a library-level task. It is easy to introduce support for
    an obscure architecture or operating system, and it is even possible to
    target multiple platforms in different parts of the same program.
