Hi! I'm Andrew, or [@abel1502](https://github.com/abel1502), as you might
know me. I'll start by pointing out that I'm not a good writer nor
a front-end dev. I'm currently a 4th year student at
[MIPT](https://mipt.ru/english/), studying computer science. I've recently taken
up creating the Bondrewd programming language, to which this site is dedicated.
I've already covered a lot of the concepts behind it in the
[docs](https://bondrewd.readthedocs.io/), so I won't be repeating myself much in
this post. In this blog, I intend to share some of my more experimental ideas
before I'm willing to commit them to the docs, as well as describe the
established concepts in more detail. 

It is important to note that Bondrewd is still in its infancy, with only the
parser _(or rather, a custom parser generator and a grammar definition for it)_
and the AST being implemented so far. I'm currently mostly occupied with
figuring out the particularities of the language's design, in order to ensure
perfection for the core part as early as possible. I have, in fact, accumulated
a lot of ideas besides the ones already documented, and I will likely share
them in this blog at some point.

This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The design is my own, so I'm open to
any suggestions on how to improve it.
